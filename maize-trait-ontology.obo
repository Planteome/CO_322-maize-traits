Wilted plants remain standing when dry, and small, dark-brown lesions develop in the lowest internodes. When infected stalks are split, the phloem appears dark brown, and there is a general conspicuous browning of tissues. In the final stages of infection, pith is shredded and surrounding tissues become discolored.\nNote: Used when casual pathogen at species level is unidentified.

comment: Minimum number: on 2-3 stages along the crop cycle:\nVegetative stage: 1 month after planting; Flowering: only for inbred lines; Grain filling: 2 and 4 weeks after anthesis in inbred lines and 4 weeks after anthesis for hybrids.\nOptimum number of measurements: \nVegetative stage: Weekly measurements from 2 to 6 weeks after planting; Flowering: only for inbred lines; Grain filling: Weekly from 1 to 4  weeks after anthesis in inbred lines and 2 to 4 weeks after anthesis for hybrids. In case of hybrids under well watered conditions measurements may be continued until one week prior maturity.\nThe reason to do not measure NDVI of hybrids at flowering is because readings are usually saturated (i.e. which correspond to NDVI values beyond 0.65) and therefore precision is negatively affected.

comment: Take the measures in the middle between leaf tip and leaf base, and in between leaf midrib and leaf rim. Blade sections measured must to be exposed to sunlight for at least the 30 minutes before.  Measurements always performed in the same side of the leaf (usually the lower or abaxial one). One measurement per leaf, and at least 3 per plot. 1 min per measurement. Optimal period for measurements: from 10 -14 h; if needed it may be expanded from 10-15h of sunny days. Never touch with the finger the area where the clamp will be placed. Measurements are recorded in continuum and downloaded in the computer as a unique excel file.

comment: Measure preferably the same side of the leaf (in this case the upper or adaxial). Leaves (i.e. insertion level within the plant), blade section of the leaf, measuring period and environmental conditions for measurements as for the stomatal conductance, but giving more emphasis to the steadiness of environmental conditions (sunny days, no clouds passing and lack of wind). One measurement per leaf, and at least 3 per plot. Each measurement may take few seconds. Usually these thermometers have not data logger so it is needed a second person to record the readings.
